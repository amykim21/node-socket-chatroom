Creative Portion:
1) Profanity Filter:
If a user types a profanity into the chat, the message will show up as a string of '*' characters (however long the profanity is) in the chatlog.

2) Timestamp:
If a user sends a message or a private message, the time the message was sent will
show up as grey text after the actual message in the chatlog.

3) Announcements:
The creator of a room can upload an announcement which will stay in the top of the chatlog.  Any users who join the room can immediately see the announcement.  The creator
can also edit the announcement.
